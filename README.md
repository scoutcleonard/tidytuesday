# Tidy Tuesday Repository

## Scout Leonard

This repository contains my attempts at Tidy Tuesday data visualizations
in R using data from R for Data Science's [Tidy Tuesday Github
repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

I do not participate in Tidy Tuesday every week, but when I do, I create
a quarto documents for the week's project named with the Tidy Tuesday
date, in a folder with the same date, and these are organized in folders
by year in this repository.

Below are some of my visualizations with their source code linked for
reference.

# Artists in the U.S.

This was inspired by the [R Ladies Santa Barbara presentation "aRt +
ggplot"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0i6KAahLY8&t=2384s) from
[Ijeamaka Anyene](https://twitter.com/ijeamaka_a). I was really excited
to learn to do radial visualizations! And to use ATLA data :)

# Birds of Australia

My first ever Tidy Tuesday!

My first Tidy Tuesday visualization. I won a cupcake for this one in a
challenge with my classmates!
